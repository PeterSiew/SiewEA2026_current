1. Here is the code for "Current policies and historical trends constrain future mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet" by Siew et al. 2026

# To construct Figure 1, Figure S1, and Figure S2
- fig1_figS1_take_one_out_validation_autoregress.py

# To construct Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure S3, Table S1 and Table S2
- fig2_fig3_GMT_SLR_fractional_idealized.py

# To construct Figure 4, Figure S4
- fig4_idealized_gmt.py

# To construct Figure S5, Figure S6
- plot_sle_timeseries_four_simulations.py

# To construct Figure S7
- create_obs_constrain_weight.py

# To create Figure S7
- create_save_parameters.py

# To create Figure S9
- posteria_model_multiple.py

2. The following are the saved files (unzip them)
# The save global-mean timeseries
- save_gmt.z01

# The save IMBIE Greenland timeseries
- save_obsSLR.zip

# The save 1,000 parameter list and the weights
- save_parameters.zip

3. The following are the codes for preparing data (you don't need to run them as the timeseries, weights are already uploaded)

# To creates global-mean surface air temperature timeseries for BEST and ERA5 dataset for Figure S7
- create_GMT_global_and_Greenland_from_spatial_BEST_ERA5.py

# To create global-mean surface air temperature timeseries for CMIP5 four RCPs for all GCMs
- create_GMT_global_from_timeseries.py

# To create global-mean surface air temperature timeseries from Climate Action tracker's four policy actions for Figure 2
- create_CATs_Nov2025_new.py

# To create stabalized GMT profiles for Figure 4
- create_idealized_stabale_GMT_new.py

# Create save_Y_predict for Figure S9
- Modify lines 216-217 in fig2_fig3_GMT_SLR_fractional_idealized.py

# The following contains the functions for reading data and analysis
- functions_read_gmt_training_data_seperate.py
- tools.py
